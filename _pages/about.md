# 🚗 Research Experience
My research interests include data mining, machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning, with methodological advances in computer science (e.g., explainable AI and dynamic system modeling) and information systems (e.g., predictive modeling, prescriptive analytics, and human-AI collaboration). Utilizing the MIMIC-III/IV and eICU databases, I have established substantial expertise in ICU-related studies, including:
- Early prediction of sepsis onset in ICU patients
- Disease phenotype identification
- Short- and long-term outcome prediction for ICU patients
- Optimal treatment policy learning from observational data


# ⭕ Current Research Interests
- Decision-making under Uncertainty
  - Developing robust policy optimization methods for heterogeneous clinical datasets
  - Constructing actionable decision support frameworks when optimal policies are unattainable 
  - Theoretical characterization of decision-support capability boundaries in medical applications
- Interpretable AI & Validation Methodologies
  - Causal machine learning using observational data
  - Interpretable reinforcement learning
