# ❕ Research Focus
My research focuses on leveraging advanced artificial intelligence techniques to analyze large-scale ICU clinical data for knowledge discovery. Utilizing the MIMIC-III/IV and eICU databases, I have established substantial expertise in ICU-related studies, including:
- Early prediction of sepsis onset in ICU patients
- Disease phenotype identification
- Short- and long-term outcome prediction for ICU patients
- Optimal treatment policy learning from observational data


# ⭕ Current Research Interests
- Decision-making under Uncertainty
  - Developing robust policy optimization methods for heterogeneous clinical datasets
  - Constructing actionable decision support frameworks when optimal policies are unattainable 
  - Theoretical characterization of decision-support capability boundaries in medical applications
- Interpretable AI & Validation Methodologies
  - Causal machine learning using observational data
  - Interpretable reinforcement learning
